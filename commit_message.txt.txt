feat(db): Add dynamic DB provider support (SQL Server, Postgres, SQLite, In-Memory)

Implemented dynamic database provider selection based on the "Provider" key in appsettings.json. The application now supports multiple database backends.

Added NuGet packages for SQL Server and Postgres.

Aligned all EF Core, Identity, and Npgsql package versions to 8.0.4 to resolve migration generation conflicts.

Improved startup logic to safely handle migration/seeding errors and skip migrations for In-Memory DB.
